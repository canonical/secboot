// checkBootManagerCodeMeasurements performs some checks on the boot manager code PCR (4).
//
// The supplied context is used to attach an EFI variable backend to, for functions that read
// from EFI variables. The supplied env and log arguments provide other inputs to this function.
// The pcrAlg argument is the PCR bank that is chosen as the best one to use. The loadImages
// argument provides a way to supply the load images associated with the current boot, in the
// order in which they are loaded. The caller must supply at least the IBL (initial boot loader,
// loaded by the firmware), and the SBL (secondary boot loader, loaded by the IBL), if there is an
// event in the log for it. These images are used to verify the digests of the
// EV_EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_APPLICATION events. Other images are optional, but if not all
// EV_EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_APPLICATION events can be verified, this will set the
// bootManagerCodeNotAllLaunchDigestsVerified flag.
//
// This function ensures that the pre-OS environment is well formed. Either it contains a single
// EV_OMIT_BOOT_DEVICE_EVENT event or an optional EV_EFI_ACTION "Calling EFI Application from Boot
// Option" event if the EV_OMIT_BOOT_DEVICE_EVENT event is not present. If the EV_EFI_ACTION event
// is present, then the next expected event is the EV_SEPARATOR to signal the transition to OS-present.
// The function considers any EV_EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_APPLICATION events before this to be system
// preparation applications, and it will set the bootManagerCodeSysprepAppsPresent flag if any are
// detected. If the BootOptionSupport EFI variable indicates that sysprep apps are not supported but
// they are present, then an error is returned.
//
// The function expects the next event after the EV_SEPARATOR to be a EV_EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_APPLICATION
// event, either the one associated with the IBL (initial boot loader), or a component of Absolute. If
// it is Absolute, then this sets the bootManagerCodeAbsoluteComputraceRunning flag, and it then expects
// the next event to be the one associated with the IBL (based on the value of the BootCurrent EFI variable,
// and the corresponding EFI_LOAD_OPTION in the TCG log). If the event data is inconsistent with the
// EFI_LOAD_OPTION for BootCurrent, it returns an error. It verifies that the digest of the event matches
// the Authenticode digest of the first supplied image, and returns an error if it isn't.
//
// Once the IBL image digest is verified, then the digests of all other EV_EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_APPLICATION
// events in the log are checked, if enough images associated with the current boot are supplied via the
// loadImages argument. It isn't possible to determine whether these events are generated by the firmware
// via a call to LoadImage, or whether they are generated by an OS component using the EFI_TCG2_PROTOCOL.
// In any case, if any OS component loads the next component itself and measures a digest directly without
// using the LoadImage API, it depends on the presence of the EFI_TCG2_PROTOCOL interface with support for
// the PE_COFF_IMAGE flag. There's no direct way to test for this, so for this reason, this function requires
// that the EV_EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_APPLICATION digest associated with the SBL (secondary boot-loader), if
// there is one, matches the Authenticode digest of the second image supplied via the loadImages argument,
// and this must be supplied. It's not necessary to supply additional load images, although if there are any
// more EV_EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_APPLICATION events without a corresponding boot image to test it against, the
// function sets the bootManagerCodeNotAllLaunchDigestsVerified flag.
