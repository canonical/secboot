// checkSecureBootPolicyMeasurementsAndObtainAuthorities performs some checks on the secure boot policy PCR (7).

// The supplied context is used to attach an EFI variable backend to, for functions that read
// from EFI variables. The supplied env and log arguments provide other inputs to this function.
// The pcrAlg argument is the PCR bank that is chosen as the best one to use. The iblImage
// corresponds to the initial boot loader image for the current boot. This is used to detect the
// launch of the OS, at which checks for PCR7 end. There are some limitations of this, ie, we may
// not detect LoadImage bugs that happen later on, but once the OS has loaded, it's impossible to
// tell whicj events come from firmware and which are under the control of OS components.

// This ensures that secure boot is enabled, else an error is returned, as WithSecureBootPolicyProfile
// only generates profiles compatible with secure boot being enabled.

// If the version of UEFI is >= 2.5, it also makes sure that the secure boot mode is "deployed mode".
// If the secure boot mode is "user mode", then the "AuditMode" and "DeployedMode" values are measured to PCR7,
// something that WithSecureBootPolicyProfile doesn't support today. Support for "user mode" will be added
// in the future, although the public RunChecks API will probably require a flag to opt in to supporting user
// mode, as it is the less secure mode of the 2 (see the documentation for SecureBootMode in
// github.com/canonical/go-efilib).

// It also reads the "OsIndicationsSupported" variable to test for features that are not supported by
// WithSecureBootPolicyProfile. These are timestamp revocation (which requires an extra signature database -
// "dbt") and OS recovery (which requires an extra signature database -"dbr", used to control access to
// OsRecoveryOrder and OsRecover#### variables). Of the 2, it's likely that we might need to add support for
// timestamp revocation at some point in the future.

// It reads the "BootCurrent" EFI variable and matches this to the EFI_LOAD_OPTION associated with the current
// boot from the TCG log - it uses the log as "BootXXXX" EFI variables can be updated at runtime and
// might be out of data when this code runs. It uses this to detect the launch of the initial boot loader,
// which might not necessarily be the first EV_EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_APPLICATION event in the OS-present
// environment in PCR4 (eg, if Absolute is active).

// After these checks, it iterates over the secure boot configuration in the log, making sure that the
// configuration is measured in the correct order, that the event data is valid, and that the measured digest
// is the tagged hash of the event data. It makes sure that the value of "SecureBoot" in the log is consistent
// with the "SecureBoot" variable (which is read-only at runtime), and it verifies that all of the signature
// databases are formatted correctly and can be decoded. It will return an error if any of these checks fail.

// If the pre-OS environment contains events other than EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG, it will return an error.
// This can happen a firmware debugger is enabled, in which case PCR7 will begin with a EV_EFI_ACTION
// "UEFI Debug Mode" event. This case is detected by earlier firmware protection checks.

// If not all of the expected secure boot configuration is measured, an error is returned.

// Once the secure boot configuration has been measured, it looks for EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY events in PCR7,
// until it detects the launch of the initial boot loader. It verifies that each of these come from db, and
// if the log is in the OS-present environment, it ensures that the measured digest is the tagged hash of the
// event data. It doesn't do this for events in the pre-OS environment because WithSecureBootPolicyProfile
// just copies these to the profile. It verifies that the firmware doesn't measure a signature more than once.
// For each EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY event, it also matches the measured signature to a EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST
// structure in db. If the matched ESL is a X.509 certificate, it records the use of this CA in the return value.
// If the CA is an RSA certificate with a public modulus of < 256 bytes, it sets a flag in the return value
// indicating a weak algorithm. If the matched ESL is a Authenticode digest, it sets a flag in the return value
// indicating that pre-OS components were verified using digests rather than signatures. This only applies to the
// pre-OS environment and makes PCR7 fragile wrt firmware updates, because it means db needs to be updated to
// reflect the new components each time. If the digest being matched is SHA-1, it sets the flag in the return
// value indicating a weak algorithm. If any of these checks fail, an error is returned. If an event type
// other than EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY is detected, an error is returned.

// Upon detecting the launch of the initial boot loader in PCR4, it extracts the authenticode signatures from
// the supplied image, and matches these to a previously measured CA. If no match is found, an error is returned.
// If a match is found, it ensures that the signing certificate has an RSA public key with a modulus that is at
// least 256 bytes, else it sets a flag in the return value indicating a weak algorithm.
//
// Once the event for the initial boot loader is complete, the function returns. It doesn't process any more
// EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY events because it's impossible to determine if these result from a call to the
// firmware's LoadImage API, or if they are logged by an OS component, both of which may maintain their own
// de-duplication lists (this is certainly the case for shim). Ideally, checking would continue but this trade
// off was made instead.
//
// If the end of the log is reached without encountering the launch of the initial boot loader, an error is returned.
