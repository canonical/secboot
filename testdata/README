- efivars/ contains:
  - a KEK database from a Dell Precision Workstation 7510.
  - a UEFI signature database from the same machine, containing the 2 Microsoft CAs.
  - a UEFI forbidden signature database from the same machine, with MS-2016-08-08.bin applied.
- efivars1/ contains:
  - a KEK database from a QEMU instance running OVMF with "Ubuntu OVMF Secure Boot (PK/KEK key)", "Microsoft
    Corporation KEK CA 2011" and a test KEK CA certificate enrolled.
  - a UEFI signature database from the same QEMU instance with "Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011",
    "Microsoft Corporation UEFI CA 2011" and a test CA certificate enrolled.
  - a UEFI forbidden signature database from the same QEMU instance with a single SHA-256 signature.
- efivars2/ contains:
  - The same KEK database from efivars1/.
  - The same UEFI signature database from efivars1/, but with a second test CA certificate enrolled.
  - The same UEFI forbidden signature database from efivars1/
- efivars3/ contains:
  - The same KEK database from efivars1/.
  - The same UEFI signature database from efivars1/
  - The same UEFI signature database from efivars1/, but with MS-2016-08-08.bin applied.

- updates/ contains the MS-2016-08-08.bin dbx update.
- updates1/ contains a UEFI db update containing the second test CA certificate already enrolled in efivars2/.
- updates2/ contains a UEFI forbidden signature db update based on the contents of the forbidden signature
  database from efivars3/, but with 2 sha256 signatures changed (one digest and one owner GUID).
- updates3/ contains updates from updates/ and updates1/

- eventlog1.bin is an event log from a QEMU instance running OVMF with the following configuration:
  - "Ubuntu OVMF Secure Boot (PK/KEK key)" enrolled in to PK.
  - KEK database, UEFI database and forbidden signature databases from efivars1/.
  - Booted with a version of shim signed by the test UEFI CA key, Grub signed by Canonical's archive key (the
    issuer of which is shim's embedded vendor cert) and a custom kernel signed by the test UEFI CA key.
- eventlog2.bin is an event log from the same QEMU instance but with with secure boot validation disabled in shim
  via MokSBState.
- eventlog3.bin is an event log from a QEMU instance running OVMF with the following configuration:
  - "Ubuntu OVMF Secure Boot (PK/KEK key)" enrolled in to PK.
  - KEK database, UEFI database and forbidden signature databases from efivars1/.
  - Booted with a version of shim verified by the test UEFI CA key. The shim build contains the second test CA
    certificate from efivars2/, which is used to verify GRUB and the kernel.
- eventlog4.bin is an event log from the same QEMU instance as eventlog3.bin, with the following difference:
  - UC20 style layout (recovery GRUB -> normal GRUB -> kernel). Everything is verified by the test CA in the UEFI db.
- eventlog5.bin is an event log from the same QEMU instance as eventlog4.bin, with the following differences:
  - UEFI signature DB updates from updates1/ are applied
- eventlog6.bin is an event log from the same QEMU instance as eventlog5.bin, with the following differences
  - Booted with a kernel that's verified by the second test CA certificate.
- eventlog7.bin is from the same QEMU instance as eventlog1.bin, but with secure boot disabled.

- mock.efi is a mock EFI executable that has no signature.
- mock.efi.signed.1 is a mock EFI executable signed with the key from a certificate issued by the test CA in
  efivars1/.
- mock.efi.signed.2 is the same as mock.efi.signed.1 but signed with the key from a certificate issued by the
  second test CA in efivars2/.

- mockshim1.efi.signed.1 is a mock EFI executable signed with the key from a certificate issued by the test
  CA in efivars1/, and a ".vendor_cert" section containing the same test CA certificate.
- mockshim1.efi.signed.2 is the same as mockshim1.efi.signed.1 but signed with the key from a certificate issued
  by the second test CA in efivars2/.
- mockshim2.efi.signed.1 is a mock EFI executable signed with the key from a certificate issued by the test CA
  in efivars1/, and a ".vendor_cert" section containing the second test CA certificate from efivars2/.
- mockshim2.efi.signed.2 is the same as mockshim2.efi.signed.1 but signed with the key from a certificate issued
  by the second test CA in efivars2/.
- mockshim.efi.signed.1 is a mock EFI executable signed with the key from a certificate issued by the test CA
  in efivars1/, and a ".vendor_cert" section containing no certificate.
