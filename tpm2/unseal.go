// Unsealing uses a policy session that is salted with the SRK that is used to protect the key
// and uses the same session for response encryption. Note that this only provides protection
// against passive interposer attacks. There is no effort to protection against active
// interposer attacks (where an advesary can modify communications) for a few reasons:
//   - An adversary can remove the encrypt attribute from the session and redirect the command
//     to a session for which they can compute the HMAC. The host CPU will detect this because the
//     response HMAC will be invalid, but it's too late at this point. Using TPM2_EncryptDecrypt2
//     with both command and response parameter encryption could mitigate this attack.
//   - An adversary can modify and spoof PCR extends earlier in the boot chain, unless all
//     critical commands like these are integrity protected with a session that is salted with a
//     verified TPM key. This is not the case with any firmware today.
//   - Protecting against an active interposer would require the use of a verified key. There is
//     one - the endorsement key, but what happens if we don't have access to and can't download
//     intermediate certs for verification? Does the boot fail? How is this communicated securely
//     to the TPM?
//   - The use of go's crypto/x509 for certificate verification doesn't permit disabling validity
//     period valdidation. Hardware certificates will generally expire during the lifetime of a
//     device and ignoring validity periods is generally quite normal here (eg, such as in UEFI
//     secure boot).
//   - An adversary could go one step further and just unsolder the discrete TPM and place
//     it into a malcious platform that spoofs a specific host.
//
// If a session is supplied, it should be a HMAC session with the AttrContinueSession
// attribute set, used for authenticating use of the storage hierarchy if a transient
// storage primary key needs to be created, in order to avoid transmitting the cleartext
// authorization value.
